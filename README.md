# :wave: Hi, I'm Josh! :atom:

I'm a data scientist with a passion for cybersecurity, space flight, and robotics. I've previously worked in nuclear power and have studied Data Science, Cybersecurity, Engineering Management (Systems Engineering), and Workforce Education.

## :open_file_folder: Projects

Here are a few examples of what I've done:

- [Good Bill Hunting NLP](https://github.com/good-bill-hunting/political_parser): Collected all federal congressional bills proposed from 2001 to 2022 and coded machine learning models to predict if a bill would receive partisan and bipartisan support to have an increased likelihood of passing Congress. [Final notebook](https://github.com/good-bill-hunting/political_parser/blob/main/final_notebook.ipynb).

- [Speakeasy Casino NLP](https://github.com/JoshuaHolt-Tech/ace-archives): Predicts the programming language of GitHub repositories containing the word "casino". [Final notebook](https://github.com/JoshuaHolt-Tech/ace-archives/blob/main/final_product.ipynb).

- [Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://github.com/JoshuaHolt-Tech/proactive-maintence-project): A machine learning project that predicts equipment failure. [Final notebook](https://github.com/JoshuaHolt-Tech/proactive-maintence-project/blob/main/final_pred_maint.ipynb).

- [Wine Quality Clustering](https://github.com/pour-choices/wine_clustering_project): Utilized clustering to analyze key features and coded machine learning models to predict a wine’s quality rating. [Final notebook](https://github.com/pour-choices/wine_clustering_project/blob/main/blind_tastings.ipynb).

## :telescope: What I'm Working On

Currently I'm learning and working on a project involving network analysis. I'm using Python and Scapy to analyze network traffic to identify potential security threats. You can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/JoshuaHolt-Tech/network_traffic_analysis).
