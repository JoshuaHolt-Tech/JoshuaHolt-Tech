- :call_me_hand: Hey, I’m Josh :atom:
- :open_book: Data science, cyber security, space flight and eventually robotics are a few areas I enjoy learning about.
- :books: Previously I've worked in nuclear power and studied Data Science, Cybersecurity, Engineering Management (Systems Engineering) and Workforce Education.

- :ringed_planet: If you're not from around here, this is how my GitHub is set up:
